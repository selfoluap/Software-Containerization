# Stage 1: Build an image that can build the Angular application 
FROM node as build-container 
# Specify the working directory inside the container 
WORKDIR /app 
# Copy the package*.json file inside the container so it can tell npm what packages to install

# Run the installation of all the packages required in package*.json 
RUN npm install 
# Copy the source code of the application into the /app folder of the container 
COPY . /app 
# Specify that we want a production build (smaller) 
ARG configuration=production 
# Run the actual build and put the output in the folder /app/dist/out in the container 
RUN npm run build --configuration $configuration 
# Stage 2, create a container with nginx 
# that serves the files created in the previous build

FROM nginx 
# We copy the files that were created in the previous build to the folder where nginx expects them 
COPY --from=build-container /app/build/ /usr/share/nginx/html 
# We copy the nginx configuration frile form the host to the nginx installation 
COPY /frontend-nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
